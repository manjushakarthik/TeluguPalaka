# Recording Telugu Vowel Sounds

Put your recorded files in this folder (`public/audio/`). The app will use them when you tap "Play sound" and will fall back to the browser’s speech if a file is missing.

## File names (exact)

Use these **exact** filenames. You can use **MP3** or **WAV**.

| Filename   | Letter | What to say (approximate sound) |
|-----------|--------|----------------------------------|

## What to record

- **One word or one sound per file:** Say **only** the vowel sound (or the letter name), clearly and once.
- **Length:** About **0.5–1.5 seconds** per file. Short and clear is better than long.
- **Example:** For `a.mp3`, say the sound of అ once (like the "u" in "but"), then stop.

## How to record

### Option 1: Phone

1. Open **Voice Memos** (iPhone) or **Recorder** (Android).
2. Record in a quiet place, phone about a hand’s width from your mouth.
3. Say the vowel once, then stop the recording.
4. Share/export as **MP3** or **WAV** (or use a converter app if needed).
5. Rename the file to the exact name in the table (e.g. `a.mp3`) and put it in `public/audio/`.

### Option 2: Computer (Mac)

1. Open **QuickTime Player** → File → New Audio Recording.
2. Click the record button, say the vowel once, then stop.
3. File → Export → save as **Audio Only** (e.g. MP3 or WAV).
4. Rename to the exact filename (e.g. `a.mp3`) and put it in `public/audio/`.

### Option 3: Computer (Windows)

1. Use **Voice Recorder** (built-in) or **Audacity** (free).
2. Record in a quiet room, say the vowel once, then stop.
3. Export/save as **MP3** or **WAV**.
4. Rename to the exact filename (e.g. `a.mp3`) and put it in `public/audio/`.

### Option 4: Online recorder

1. Use a site like **online-voice-recorder.com** or **vocaroo.com**.
2. Record the vowel once, then download as MP3/WAV.
3. Rename to the exact filename and put it in `public/audio/`.

## Tips

- **Quiet room** – less background noise.
- **Same distance** – keep the mic at the same distance for all files so volume is even.
- **One take** – one clear vowel per file; you can re-record until it sounds good.
- **Native speaker** – if possible, ask a Telugu speaker to record for best pronunciation.

## After recording

1. Put all files in: `telugupalaka/public/audio/`
2. Names must match exactly: `a.mp3`, `aa.mp3`, `i.mp3`, … (or `.wav`).
3. Restart or refresh the app. The app will use these files when they exist and use the browser’s speech only for missing ones.
